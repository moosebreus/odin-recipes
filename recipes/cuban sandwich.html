<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There are different recipes for Cuban sandwiches. Here's how I build my Cuban, or Cubano. I like to use pulled pork. Carnitas would work too. These ingredients and amounts are open to your own personal preferences, but here's a general idea.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1/4 cup mayonaise</li>
    <li>1/4 cup mustard</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) loaf Cuban bread</li>
    <li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>
    <li>6 thin slices smoked fully-cooked ham</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups cooked pulled pork, heated</li>
    <li>1 karge dill pickle, sliced thinly lenghtwise</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Mix mayonnaise, mustard, and cayenne together in a bowl to make sauce.</li>
    <li>Trim off ends of bread. Cut loaf in half and evenly split bread to make tops and bottoms of two sandwiches.</li>
    <li>Spread each half on both sides generously with mayo-mustard sauce.</li>
    <li>Divide sandwich ingredients between the two bottom halves in this order: 2 slices Swiss cheese, 3 slices ham, hot cooked pork, pickle slices, and 2 more slices Swiss cheese. Place tops on sandwiches.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Place sandwiches in the skillet and press down with a heavy weight, such as another skillet or foil-wrapped bricks. Toast sandwiches until bread is crisp and filling is heated through, 3 or 4 minutes per side.</li>
